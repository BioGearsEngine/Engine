#UniqueName=Directory to process, the baseline directory, Sort=, Divsor=
# - Results will be normalized to the provided baseline directory
# - Sort=Key, where any results column name containing the Key string in it, will be placed into a results file with the Key name
# - A popular use of sort is : Sort=Flow, Sort=Volume, Sort=Pressure
# - You can have as many Sort= as you want
# - The Divisor= is used to specify a results colume that you would like to divide other results by
# - For example you can divide all of the flows by cardiac output to ensure that flow fractions don’t change significantly when scaling
# - For example you can divide all of the volumes by total blood volume to ensure that volume fractions don’t change significantly when scaling
# - You would do the following for that : <TODO>

This example shows how to handle raw, "type-less content" such as
mixed content models, anyType/anySimpleType, and any/anyAttribute
in the C++/Parser mapping.

In this example we use mixed content model to describe text
with embedded links, e.g.,

    This paragraph talks about <a href="uri">time</a>.

The example transforms such text into plain text with
references, e.g.,

    This paragraph talks about time[0].

    [0] uri

The example consists of the following files:

text.xsd
  XML Schema which describes "text with links" instance
  documents.

text.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

anchor.hxx
  Anchor type that captures the information about a link.

text.map
  Type map. It maps XML Schema anchor types defined in
  text.xsd to C++ anchor class defined in anchor.hxx.

text-pskel.hxx
text-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by XSD from text.xsd and
  text.map.

driver.cxx
  A parser implementation and a driver for the example. The
  parser implementation prints the transformed text to STDOUT.
  The driver first constructs a parser instance from the parser
  implementation mentioned above and a couple of predefined
  parsers for the XML Schema built-in types. In then invokes
  this parser instance to parse the input file.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply
execute:

$ ./driver text.xml

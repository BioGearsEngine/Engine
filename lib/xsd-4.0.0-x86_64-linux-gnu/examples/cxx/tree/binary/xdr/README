This example shows how to save/load the object model to/from XDR
(eXternal Data Representation) binary format using XDR streams.
The XDR API is available out of the box on most UNIX and GNU/Linux
systems as part of Sun RPC. On Windows you may need to install a
third-party library which provides the XDR API.

The example consists of the following files:

library.xsd
  XML Schema which describes a library of books.

library.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

library.hxx
library.cxx
  C++ types that represent the given vocabulary as well as data
  representation stream insertion and extraction operations. These
  are generated by XSD from library.xsd. Note that the
  --generate-insertion and --generate-extraction options are used
  to generate the insertion and extraction operations for XDR
  stream.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It first calls one of the parsing functions
  that constructs the object model from the input XML file. It then
  saves the object model to the XDR representation and loads it back.
  Additionally, it prints the content of the object model before saving
  it to the XDR representation and after loading it from the XDR
  representation.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply execute:

$ ./driver library.xml

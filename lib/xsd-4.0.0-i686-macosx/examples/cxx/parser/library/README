This example shows how to use the C++/Parser mapping to construct
a custom in-memory object model from XML instance documents.

The example consists of the following files:

library.xsd
  XML Schema which describes a library of books.

library.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

library.hxx
  Types that describe a library of books in C++. These are
  hand-written.

library.map
  Type map. It maps XML Schema types defined in library.xsd
  to the C++ types defined in library.hxx.

library-pskel.hxx
library-pskel.ixx
library-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by XSD from library.xsd and
  library.map.

library-pimpl.hxx
library-pimpl.cxx
  Parser implementations that construct the custom in-memory
  object model from an XML instance using the types from
  library.hxx. These are hand-written implementations of
  the parser skeletons defined in library-pskel.hxx.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It first constructs a parser
  instance from all the individual parsers found in
  library-pimpl.hxx. In then invokes this parser instance
  to parse the input file and produce the in-memory
  object model. Finally, it prints the contents of the
  in-memory object model to STDERR.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply
execute:

$ ./driver library.xml

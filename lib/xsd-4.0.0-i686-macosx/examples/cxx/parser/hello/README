This is a "Hello, world!" example that shows how to use the
C++/Parser mapping to parse XML instance documents.

The example consists of the following files:

hello.xsd
  XML Schema which describes "hello" instance documents.

hello.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

hello-pskel.hxx
hello-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by XSD from hello.xsd.

driver.cxx
  A parser implementation and a driver for the example. The
  parser implementation simply prints the data to STDERR.
  The driver first constructs a parser instance from the
  parser implementation mentioned above and a couple of
  predefined parsers for the XML Schema built-in types.
  In then invokes this parser instance to parse the input
  file.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply
execute:

$ ./driver hello.xml

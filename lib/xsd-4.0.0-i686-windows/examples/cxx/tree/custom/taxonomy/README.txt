This example shows how to map user-defined XML Schema types to custom C++
classes. It presents the complex case where the customized types are
inherited from in the same schema. For the simple case see the contacts
example. For more information on the C++/Tree mapping customization see
the C++/Tree Mapping Customization Guide[1].

The example consists of the following files:

people.xsd
  XML Schema definition for a simple people database.

people.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

people-fwd.hxx
people.hxx
people.ixx
people.cxx
  C++ types that represent the given vocabulary and a set of parsing
  functions that convert XML instance documents to a tree-like in-memory
  object model. These are generated by XSD from people.xsd with the
  --custom-type option in order to customize the person, superman, and
  batman types. Generation of the people-fwd.hxx forward declaration
  file is requested with the --generate-forward option. Note also that 
  we use the --generate-polymorphic command line option as well as 
  --polymorphic-type to mark the type hierarchy starting with the 
  person type as polymorphic.

people-custom-fwd.hxx
  Header file which forward-declares our own person, superman, and batman
  as class templates. It is included at the beginning of people-fwd.hxx
  using the --fwd-prologue option.

people-custom.hxx
  Header file which defines our own person, superman, and batman class
  templates by inheriting from the generated person_base, superman_base,
  and batman_base. It is included at the beginning of people.hxx using
  the --hxx-prologue option.

people-custom.cxx
  Source file which contains the implementations and instantiations of
  our person, superman, and batman class templates.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It first calls one of the parsing functions
  that constructs the object model from the input file. It then prints
  the database to STDERR.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply execute:

$ ./driver people.xml

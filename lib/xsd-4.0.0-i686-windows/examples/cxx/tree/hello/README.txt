This is a "Hello, world!" example that shows how to use the C++/Tree
mapping to access XML instance documents described by XML Schema
definitions.

The example consists of the following files:

hello.xsd
  XML Schema which describes "hello" instance documents.

hello.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

hello.hxx
hello.cxx
  C++ types that represent the given vocabulary and a set of parsing
  functions that convert XML instance documents to a tree-like in-memory
  object model. These are generated by XSD from hello.xsd.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It first calls one of the parsing functions
  that constructs the object model from the input file. It then prints
  the content of the object model to STDERR.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply execute:

$ ./driver hello.xml

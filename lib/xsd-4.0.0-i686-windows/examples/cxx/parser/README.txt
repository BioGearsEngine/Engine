This directory contains a number of examples that show how to use
the C++/Parser mapping. The following list gives an overview of
each example. See the README files in example directories for
more information on each example.

hello
  A simple "Hello, world!" example that shows how to parse XML
  documents.

generated
  Shows how to use the sample implementation and test driver
  generation feature. This example does not have any hand-written
  C++ code; everything is generated by the XSD compiler.

library
  Shows how to handle more complex data structures and construct
  a custom in-memory object model.

mixin
  Shows how to reuse implementations of base parsers in derived
  parsers using the mixin C++ idiom.

wildcard
  Shows how to parse the XML data matched by XML Schema wildcards
  (any and anyAttribute).

multiroot
  Shows how to handle XML vocabularies with multiple root elements.

polymorphism
  Shows how to use XML Schema polymorphism features such as the
  xsi:type attribute and substitution groups.

polyroot
  Shows how to handle the xsi:type attribute when it is used on root
  elements.

performance
  Measures the performance of XML parsing. This example also shows how
  to structure your code to achieve the maximum performance for this
  operation.

mixed
  Shows how to handle raw, "type-less content" such as mixed content
  models, anyType/anySimpleType, and any/anyAttribute.

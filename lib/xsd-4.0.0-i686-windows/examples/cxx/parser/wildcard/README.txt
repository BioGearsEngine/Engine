This example shows how to parse the XML data matched by XML Schema
wildcards (any and anyAttribute) in the C++/Parser mapping. The
example consists of the following files:

email.xsd
  XML Schema which describes a simple email format with the
  extensible envelope type.

email.xml
  Sample email message.

email-pskel.hxx
email-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by XSD from email.xsd.

driver.cxx
  Parser implementations and a driver for the example. The
  parser implementations simply print the data to STDERR.
  The driver first constructs parser instances from the
  parser implementations mentioned above and a couple of
  predefined parsers for the XML Schema built-in types.
  In then invokes the parser instances to parse the input
  file.

To run the example on the sample XML instance document simply execute:

$ ./driver email.xml
